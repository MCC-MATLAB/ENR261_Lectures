                ---

                ## Introduction to the MATLAB Interface

                ### What is MATLAB?

                - MATLAB stands for *MATrix LABoratory*. It's a high-level programming language and interactive environment used primarily by engineers and scientists for numerical computation, visualization, and programming.

                --

                ### The MATLAB Desktop Interface

                - **Command Window**: Where you type commands and see results.
                - **Workspace**: Displays variables you've created during your session.
                - **Command History**: Keeps a record of the commands you've entered.
                - **Editor**: Used for writing scripts (M-files) and functions.
                - **Current Folder**: The current working directory.

                ---

                ### Interactive Demonstration:

                - Open MATLAB and take a tour of the interface.
                - Feel free to open MATLAB and follow along.

                ---

                ## The Command Window

                ### Used for Real-Time Interaction:

                - MATLAB allows you to interact directly with your data. For example, typing `2 + 3` and pressing <kbd class="kbc-button kbc-button-dark">enter</kbd> will immediately return `ans = 5`.

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
                    <h3>Common Commands:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>clc</code>: Clears the command window, but doesn't clear the workspace.</li>
                        <li><code>clear</code>: Clears all variables from the workspace.</li>
                        <li><code>whos</code> (<code>who</code>): Displays detailed information about variables in the workspace.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                --

                ### Interactive Exercise:

                1. Open MATLAB.
                2. Try the following commands and observe:

                ```matlab
                2 + 3 <enter>
                clc <enter>
                whos <enter>
                ```
                <div class="fragment fade-up>3. What happened after each command?</div>

                --

                ### More on the Command Window
                * `clc`: Clears the command window.
                * `clear`: Clears variables from the "Workspace/Environment".
                * `whos`: Displays a list of current variables (also seen in the Workspace window).

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
                #### Re-executing Commands:

- Use the `<up arrow>` to cycle through previously executed commands.
- Double-click or drag and drop from the command history window (may need to be enabled)

#### Important Keyboard Shortcuts:

- **Ctrl+C**: Stops the execution of a command or script if it runs too long or seems to be stuck.
                </div>

                --

                ### Learning And Executing Simple Commands

#### Computation Notation:

- MATLAB uses standard mathematical operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`.
- Try to guess the output for the following:

```matlab
3 - 2  <enter>
3 * 2  <enter>
3 / 2  <enter>
3 ^ 2  <enter>
```

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
                ```matlab
                1 + inf <enter>
                ```
                </div>

                ---

                ## Variables

### What are Variables?

- Variables store data that can be used and manipulated in your MATLAB session. MATLAB allows dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it.

                <div class="fragment fade-up>
                **Example**:

```matlab
a = 5
b = 10
c = a * b
```
                </div>

                --

                ### Standard Naming Conventions
* `camelCase`
* `snake_case`
* `ALL_CAPS`, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

                ---

                ### Important Concepts:

- **Case Sensitivity**: `Variable` and `variable` are different.
- **Naming Conventions**: Stick to clear, descriptive names to make your code easier to understand.

### Reserved Words/Variables:

- MATLAB has predefined variables, known as constants, like `pi` and functions like `inf`.
- MATLAB also has predefined functions, such as `sin`, `cos`, `clear`, `clc`, `sqrt`, etc.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Avoid using these names for your variables when possible.
</div>

                --

                ### Interactive Exercise**:

- Try the following:

```matlab
radius = 7 <enter>
height = 10 <enter>
volume = (pi * radius^2 * height) / 3 <enter>
```

                ---

                ## Algorithm Development Process:
1. Analyze the problem
1. Define inputs
1. Perform Manipulation
1. Produce Output/Result

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
### Best Practices:

- **Commenting**: Use comments (`%`) to explain your code. This helps others (and future you) understand what your code does.
- **Incremental Development**: Write and test small pieces of code before integrating them into a larger program.
                </div>

                --

                ### Problem Solving Example: Volume of a Cone

#### Applying What Weâ€™ve Learned:

1. **Analyze the problem**: Explain the formula  $\Large v = \frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}$
2. **Define inputs** (in this case variables):

```matlab
radius = 6
height = 12
```
Note: _We don't need `pi` as that's provided for us_

                                <div class="fragment fade-up">
3. **Perform the manipulation**:

```matlab
volume = (pi * radius^2 * height) / 3
```
                </div>
                                                <div class="fragment fade-up">
4. **Produce Output/Result:**

    In this case we are simply outputting to `volume` and the console (done by MATLAB)
                </div>

                ---

                ## Introduction to M-Files

### What are M-Files?

- M-files are scripts or functions you can save and reuse. They help organize code and are essential for more complex projects.

#### Usage:
* Save your programs.
* Execute a list of commands from the command window.
* Save your work while you work through a problem.
* Re-open and modify your program at any time.

                --

                ### Creating a Simple M-File:

1. Open the MATLAB Editor.
2. Type the following:

```matlab
% Compute and display the volume of a cone
radius = 6
height = 12
volume = (pi * radius^2 * height) / 3
```

3. Save as `volume_of_cone.m`.
4. Run the script by typing `volume_of_cone` in the Command Window.

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
#### Notes:
 * To run a MATLAB script call the filename without `.m`
 * The script must be in the current working directory `cwd`
     * Alternatively, you can provide a path (`C:\my\script\location.m`)
                </div>
                                <div class="fragment fade-up">
#### Output Suppression:

* When someone asks for the volume of a cone, they probably don't want to see the radius, and height displayed.
* We can use the semicolon `;` operator to suppress output. MATLAB, by default, prints command results to the command window.
                </div>

                --

                ### Updating our script

* We'll add some semicolons to suppress the output of redundant values.

```matlab
% Compute and display the volume of a cone
radius = 6;
height = 12;
volume = (pi * radius^2 * height) / 3
```

                ---

              ## Creating Quality Work:

* Write clear and understandable code.
* Add comments to document your code.
* Include a set of header comments with the program's objective, your name, anyone who assisted you.

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
                <div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>TIP!</strong> Write your comments first, then write code to honor your comments.
</div>
                </div>

                --

                ### Example Program with Expected format

```matlab
% Compute and display the volume of a cone
%
% Filename: Volume_of_cone
% Developer: Your Name
% Assisted By:
% Date: 08/04/2024

% Declare variables
radius = 6;  % Radius of the cone (inches)
height = 12; % Height of the cone (inches)

% Compute the volume of a cone
volume = (pi * radius^2 * height) / 3;
```

                --

             ### Error Handling and Debugging

#### Understanding Errors:

- **Syntax Errors**: Typos or incorrect MATLAB syntax.
- **Runtime Errors**: Occur during execution, often due to incorrect logic or unexpected input.

                --

                ### Interactive Exercise:

- Introduce an error by changing `radius` to `radiuss` in the M-file and let's observe the error message.

                <div class="fragment fade-up">
                <div class="alert alert-info fit-width">
  <strong>TIP!</strong> Start fresh to avoid confusion
</div>

* Whenever you run into a problem like this it is a good idea to `clear` your workspace of any possible bad values.
* You should include `clear;`, and sometimes `clc;` in your script to ensure you are starting fresh.
                </div>

                ---

                ## Using the Help System

### Accessing MATLAB Help:

- **In Command Window**: Type `help <enter>` to get information on a specific command.
- Right-click on a function and select "Help on `functionName`".
- **Help Browser**: Access via the <img src="./imgs/help-icon.png" style="display:inline; width:40px; height:40px; vertical-align:middle;"> icon.

                <div class="fragment fade-up>
**Example**:

- Type `help sin` to explore how MATLAB handles trigonometric functions.
                </div>

                ---

                ## General Shortcut Tips


#### Keyboard Navigation:
* `Home` and `End` keys jump to the beginning and end of the line (`Cmd`+`left`/`right` on Mac).
* Arrow keys move a single character (L/R) or row (U/D).
* `Ctrl`+`arrow` jumps by word (`Option`+`arrow` on Mac).
* Holding Shift while moving the cursor (using any of the aforementioned shortcuts), selects text.
* `Ctrl`+`c` to copy, or `Ctrl`+`x` to cut, `Ctrl`+`v` to paste. (`Cmd`+`c`, `Cmd`+`x`, `Cmd`+`v` on Mac)
* Double-click highlights a word, triple-click highlights a row.

                ---

                ## Lecture Recap

* Variables are used for storing data for re-use.'
    * Use clear, and informative names.
* M-files allow you to save and organize your work.
* The command window is immediate and can allow you to debug, or incrementally develop your code.
* Use Help whenever you're unsure of a command's syntax or usage.
* Always
    * Write clear, well-documented code
    * Include **comments**.
    * **suppress** what doesn't need to be displayed
    * Start with a `clear` workspace.
* Learn keyboard shortcuts for efficient coding.
* Save often, commit often

                ---

                <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; background-image: url('./imgs/goteem.png'); background-size: contain; background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding: 60px; min-height: 100vh; text-align: center; background-size: cover;">
    <div>
        <h2 style="color: white;">Gotchas</h2>
        <ul style="color: white;">
            <li>Variables <strong>are</strong> case sensitive, do not try to use this to your advantage.</li>
            <li>Don't forget <code>;</code> to suppress undesirable output.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to overwrite (mask) reserved variables/names.</li>
            <li>Copy and paste is your frienemy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

                ---

                ## Analogies:

- **MATLAB Interface**: Think of MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator with a built-in notebook where you can save your calculations and notes.
- **Command Window**: Imagine MATLAB M-files (scripts) as a solution to a math problem. The Command Window is like your calculator where you check your values and help you develop your scripts.
- **Variables**: Think of variables as labeled containers. You store information in them, which you can use later.
- **M-Files**: M-files are like recipes; they list the steps needed to perform a task. You can save them, modify them, and share them with others.
