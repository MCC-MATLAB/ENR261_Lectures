			## Vector Operations üßÆ
			### Vector Basics:
			**Definition**: A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers.
			#### Creating Vectors:
			```matlab
			rowVector = [1, 2, 3, 4];
			colVector = [1; 2; 3; 4];
			```

			--

			### Vector Operations:
			Element-wise Operations: Operations performed on each element of the vector.
			```matlab
			a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
			b = [5, 6, 7, 8];
			c = a + b; % Element-wise addition
			d = a .* b; % Element-wise multiplication
			```
			#### Dot Product:
			```matlab
			dotProduct = dot(a, b);
			```

			### Vector Functions:
			#### Sum:
			```matlab
			total = sum(a);
			```
			#### Mean:
			```matlab
			avg = mean(a);
			```
			#### Length:
			```matlab
			len = length(a);
			```
			#### Max and Min:
			```matlab
			maxValue = max(a);
			minValue = min(a);
			```
			#### Example:

			```matlab
			a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
			sum_a = sum(a); % Sum of elements
			mean_a = mean(a); % Mean of elements
			max_a = max(a); % Maximum element
			min_a = min(a); % Minimum element
			```
			üí° Tip: Use built-in functions like sum, mean, and max to quickly analyze vectors and avoid writing repetitive code.

			## Matrix Operations üóÉÔ∏è
			### Subscripts:
			**Definition**: Elements within a matrix are referenced using subscripts (row, column).

			#### Example:
			```matlab
			matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
			element = matrix(3, 2); % Returns element at third row, second column
			```

			--

			#### Duplicating Rows and Columns:
			Using repmat():
			```matlab
			vectorA = [1, 2, 3];
			duplicatedMatrix = repmat(vectorA, 3, 1);
			```

			--

			#### Extracting Rows and Columns:
			Using Logical Arrays:
			```matlab
			a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
			extractedCols = a(:, logical([1 0 1])); % Extracts first and third columns
			```
			üí° Tip: Logical arrays are powerful tools for selectively extracting or manipulating parts of a matrix. Use them to simplify your code.

			--

			### Elementary Matrices:
			* Functions: Create basic matrices.
				* `ones()`: Creates a matrix of ones.
				* `zeros()`: Creates a matrix of zeros.
				* `rand()`: Creates a matrix of random numbers.
				* `eye()`: Creates an identity matrix.

			#### Example:

			```matlab
			onesMatrix = ones(3);
			zerosMatrix = zeros(3);
			randMatrix = rand(3);
			identityMatrix = eye(3);
			```
			### Special Matrices:
			* Functions: Create special matrices.
				* `pascal()`
				* `magic()`
				* `gallery()`
				* `hankel()`


			#### Example:

			```matlab
			magicMatrix = magic(3);
			```

			### Matrix Operations:
			#### Matrix Multiplication:
			```matlab
			A = [1 2; 3 4];
			B = [5 6; 7 8];
			C = A * B; % Matrix multiplication
			```
			#### Element-wise Multiplication:
			```matlab
			D = A .* B; % Element-wise multiplication
			```
			#### Matrix Exponentiation:
			```matlab
			A_squared = A^2; % A^2 = A * A
			```
			‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Ensure that the dimensions of matrices match when performing matrix multiplication. Mismatched dimensions will cause errors.

			## Logical Vectors and Operations ‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è
			### Logical Vectors:
			**Definition**: Logical vectors are arrays of 1s (true) and 0s (false) resulting from element-wise comparisons between arrays.

			--

			#### Example:
			```matlab
			a = 1:5;
			b = [0 2 3 5 6];
			logicalVector = (a == b); % Element-wise comparison
			```
			#### Example Output:

			```matlab
			a == b
			ans =
			0 1 1 0 0
			```
			üí° Tip: Use logical vectors to filter or selectively operate on elements of a vector or matrix based on conditions.

			--

			### Logical Operations:
			**Operators**:
			* < : Less than
			* > : Greater than
			* == : Equal to
			* ~ : Not
			* <= : Less than or equal to
			* >= : Greater than or equal to
			* ~= : Not equal to
			* xor() : Exclusive OR

			--

			#### Example:

			```matlab
			a = [1, 2, 3];
			b = [3, 2, 1];
			logicalArray = a < b;
			```
			#### Example Output:

			```matlab
			a < b
			ans =
			1 0 0
			```

			--

			### Logical Functions:
			**Functions**:
			* `find()`: Returns indices of non-zero elements.
			`ischar()`: Checks if input is character data.
			`isinf()`: Checks for infinity.
			`isnan()`: Checks for NaN.
			`isnumeric()`: Checks if input is numeric.
			`isempty()`: Checks if input is empty.
			`any()`: Checks if any elements are non-zero.
			`all()`: Checks if all elements are non-zero.
			`exist()`: Checks if a variable exists.

			#### Example:

			```matlab
			v = [1, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4; 6, 36, 6, 7, 843, 5];
			[row, col] = find(v == 3);
			```
			#### Example Output:

			```matlab
			row =
			1
			1
			col =
			2
			5
			```
			üí° Tip: Use `find()` to quickly locate elements in a matrix that meet a specific condition.

			### Round-off Error:
			**Issue**: Comparisons can be affected by round-off errors.
			#### Example:
			```matlab
			a = 0;
			b = sin(pi);
			result = (a == b); % Due to round-off error
			```
			#### Example Output:

			```matlab
			a == b
			```
			ans =
			0

			#### Solution: Use approximate equality.
			```matlab
			abs(a - b) < 1.0e-14
			```
			ans =
			1 % Logical true

			‚ö†Ô∏è Gotcha: Be cautious when comparing floating-point numbers directly. Due to round-off errors, use approximate comparisons instead.

			--

			### Avoiding Division by Zero and Infinity
			#### Division by Zero:
			Issue: Dividing by zero results in NaN (Not a Number) in MATLAB.
			Solution: Use logical vectors to avoid division by zero.

			#### Example:

			```matlab
			x = -4pi : pi/20 : 4pi;
			y = sin(x) ./ x; % Division by zero at x = 0
			logicalVector = (x == 0);
			x = x + logicalVector*eps; % Replace zero with a small number
			```
			#### Infinity:
			Issue: Near infinity values can distort plots drastically.
			Solution: Use logical vectors to handle near-infinity values.
			#### Example:

			```matlab
			x = -3/2pi : pi/100 : 3/2pi;
			y = tan(x); % Tan function goes to infinity at odd multiples of pi/2
			y = y .* (abs(y) < 1e10); % Limit large values
			plot(x, y);
			```
			üí° Tip: Always check for and handle special cases like division by zero or infinity to ensure your code runs smoothly.

			## Key Takeaways üéì
			Vectors and matrices are fundamental data structures in MATLAB, and understanding their operations is crucial.
			Logical vectors help perform element-wise comparisons and handle special cases like division by zero and infinity.
			MATLAB provides powerful functions for matrix manipulation and analysis.

			--

			## Additional Tips üí°
			* Practice using logical vectors to make your code more efficient and handle special cases.
			* Familiarize yourself with MATLAB‚Äôs matrix manipulation functions to work effectively with matrices.
			* Regularly test your code with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.

			--

			## Gotchas to Watch Out For ‚ö†Ô∏è
			* Division by Zero: Always check for and handle division by zero to avoid NaN values.
			* Matrix Dimensions: Ensure matrix dimensions match when performing operations.
			* Round-off Errors: Be aware of round-off errors when comparing floating-point numbers.

			--

			## Analogies üîÑ
			* Vectors: Think of vectors as lists of items, such as a grocery list, where each item can be accessed by its position.
			* Matrices: Think of matrices as grids or spreadsheets where you can perform operations on rows, columns, or individual elements.
			* Logical Vectors: Logical vectors are like checklists where each item is marked as true or false based on a condition.
